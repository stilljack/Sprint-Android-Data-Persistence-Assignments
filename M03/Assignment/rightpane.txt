// instructions are not super clear, as usual for older assignments... 
// so gonna as I work through the instructions going to put the code I used, brief descriptions of results and reflections

SELECT * FROM TEAMS
// predictably returns all the rows contained in the table TEAMS

SELECT name FROM TEAMS

//woops

SELECT team_name FROM TEAMS

//there we go, returns just the names of all entries of the TEAMS table

SELECT team_name FROM TEAMS WHERE id=2

//returns "the dorks" -- as expected, returns the value of team_name from the table TEAMS  that has the id=2

SELECT team_name FROM TEAMS WHERE id>=2

//returns
// THE DORKS
//the nerds
//the also-rans
// i.e anything with id value that is equal to or greater than 2
